    The agent should use this tool when asked to review the backlog,

        analysis_type: What to analyze —
            'duplicates' (find overlapping tasks),
            'gaps' (identify missing stories for known features),
            'priority' (compute RICE scores and suggest ordering),

        Instructions for the agent to follow when analyzing the backlog.
