# PDLC Agent Fleet Roadmap

A short, honest roadmap. What shipped, what's next, and what's deferred. The aspirational "v2 Features" section from an earlier draft of this doc has been moved to a separate [ideas](#ideas-not-on-the-roadmap) section at the bottom — those aren't commitments, just a list of things worth considering when we have bandwidth.

## Vision

An autonomous agent fleet that handles the operational burden of software development — planning, documentation, business analysis, architectural alignment — so small teams can focus on building product.

---

## Shipped

| Agent | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Workitems** | PO/PM: work decomposition (approval pattern), status reports, risk detection, Asana ↔ GitHub sync | Live |
| **Researcher** | Business analyst: research synthesis, competitive scans, story drafting, spec review | Live |
| **Docwriter** | Technical writer: API docs, release notes, doc PRs, freshness checks | Live |
| **Adr** | ADR linker: tags issues with governing ADRs, reviews PRs against them | Live |

Supporting infrastructure shipped:
- **Dispatch Router** Lambda routes `@mention` events from GitHub + Asana to the right runtime.
- **Asana webhook receiver** Lambda handles Asana event subscription, signature verification, and normalization.
- **`agent-dispatch.yml`** GitHub Actions workflow handles the GitHub mention path.
- **Per-agent Cedar policies** under `cedar/<agent>.cedar` declare what each agent may and may not do.
- **UI-driven agent onboarding** — the dashboard Admin view onboards an agent by writing a capability row; a shared `sdlc-agent-builder-<stage>` CodeBuild project builds its container and the `capability-deployer` Lambda stands up its runtime and republishes the registry. A weekly `capability-rebuilder` schedule rebuilds every active agent for security patches. Base platform deployed with `scripts/deploy_fleet.py`.
- **Skills** under `skills/` drive guided install into a new repo/account.
- **Fleet monitoring + admin dashboard** (`dashboard/`) — React + Vite SPA showing run history, traces, fleet status, and the Admin view for onboarding agents/repos. Backed by query + admin API Lambdas (`infra/dashboard/`), hosted on S3 + CloudFront, published by `scripts/deploy_fleet.py`.

All four agents run Claude Opus 4.7 via Bedrock.

## Near-term (next 1–2 quarters, order is priority)

1. **Provision AgentCore Memory in the foundation template.** Agents already honor `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_ID`; what's missing is a Memory resource in `infra/foundation/template.yaml` and a documented seeding path per agent.
2. **Slack dispatch.** A capability's triggers can advertise Slack, but there's no Slack event receiver Lambda or signing-secret path. Needs a new receiver, a Slack app manifest, and routing through the existing Dispatch Router.
3. **Cedar enforcement in the invocation path.** Today Cedar policies are advisory — they document the contract. Hard enforcement via a policy evaluator invoked before each tool call is the next step.
4. **AgentCore Evaluations.** Each agent ships with `tests/eval_dataset.json`. The evaluation pipeline that scores runs against those datasets isn't wired up.
5. **Per-assignment cost tracking.** Token usage is available in Bedrock response metadata; surface it to the DynamoDB assignments table so we can report cost per run per agent.

## Medium-term (the interesting work, no commitment)

### Jira + GitLab support
Atlassian has an official remote MCP server (Jira, Confluence, Compass under one OAuth). The agent-side changes are small (point at a different MCP URL, tune prompts for Jira terminology). The dispatch side needs a Jira webhook receiver.

GitLab is harder — no production-grade official remote MCP. Community options exist (`zereight/gitlab-mcp`). Each shipping agent's system prompt would need merge-request vs. pull-request terminology adjustments.

### UAT agent
Generate Playwright tests from user stories and run them against staging. Requires a real solution for test-maintenance across UI changes, not just test-generation. Depends on AgentCore Browser (or a browser-in-Lambda fallback).

### Feedback agent
A Haiku-based agent that watches human edits to other agents' output and writes corrections to the fleet's memory. Depends on Memory being provisioned and populated (item 1 above).

### Cedar enforcement in Dispatch
Beyond tool-call-time enforcement, evaluate the full policy graph at the assignment level so the router can reject attempts before invoking the runtime.

## Ideas — not on the roadmap

Collected from earlier design sessions. Worth considering, not committed to.

- **Merge agent** — PR readiness checklist, release assembly, GTM handoff. Design doc deleted; spec was aspirational.
- **Triage agent** — Support case triage against known issues; escalate novel ones.
- **Diagnostics agent** — Incident timeline reconstruction from Datadog + PagerDuty.
- **Monitor agent** — Scheduled observability sweeps; file new issues for novel patterns.
- **Securityreviewer agent** — Threat-modeling partner on design docs; security review on PRs.
- **Bugreproducer agent** — Reproduce filed bugs with a failing test.
- **Gtm agent** — Changelogs and announcement drafts from releases.
- **Figma integration** — Pull design tokens into Docwriter, wire Figma webhooks to Dispatch.
- **AgentCore Gateway migration** — Centralize MCP access through one managed endpoint instead of per-agent direct connections.
- **AgentCore Identity migration** — Replace the SSM credential paths with a centralized Identity vault and `@requires_access_token` pattern.
- **Trello, Aha!, Linear PM support** — Workitems with different backends.
