# PDLC Agent Fleet — Setup Guide for AI Agents

This guide is written for an AI agent tasked with deploying this fleet into a new repository and AWS environment. Follow it top to bottom. Where a decision is required, stop and ask the user before proceeding.

---

## Step 0 — Understand what this fleet is

This repo contains autonomous AI agents for the software development lifecycle, deployed as containers on **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime**. A **Dispatch Router** Lambda receives `@mention` events from GitHub, Asana, and Discord, resolves them to agents, and invokes the appropriate AgentCore Runtime.

**Agents available:**

| Agent | Role | Trigger aliases |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `workitems` | PO/PM — work decomposition, status reports, risk | `@pm`, `@status`, `@plan` |
| `docwriter` | Technical writer — API docs, guides, release notes | `@docs`, `@doc`, `@writer` |
| `researcher` | Business analyst — research, competitive intel | `@ba`, `@research`, `@analyze` |
| `adr` | ADR linker — tags issues and reviews PRs against the ADR library | `@decisions`, `@architecture` |

Each deployed agent requires: an ECR repository, an AgentCore Runtime, and an entry in `.dispatch/agents.yaml`.

---

## Step 1 — Ask the user which agents to deploy

**Stop here. Ask the user:**

> Which agents do you want to deploy? Options are:
> - `workitems` (PO/PM assistant)
> - `docwriter` (technical writer)
> - `researcher` (business analyst)
> - `adr` (ADR linker)
>
> You can deploy any combination. Each one adds an ECR repo, an AgentCore Runtime, a deploy workflow, and an entry in the agent registry.

Record the user's answer. For the rest of this guide, replace `<AGENTS>` with the chosen list (e.g. `workitems docwriter`).

---

## Step 2 — Collect required values

Before touching any AWS resources, collect the following. Ask the user for any you don't have.

**AWS:**
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` — 12-digit AWS account ID
- `AWS_REGION` — deployment region (default: `us-west-2`; must have Bedrock model access)
- `GITHUB_ORG` and `GITHUB_REPO` — used to scope the OIDC trust policy
- `STAGE` — environment name: `dev`, `staging`, or `prod` (default: `dev`)

**Asana** (only if the user wants Asana triggers — ask):
- `ASANA_PAT` — Personal Access Token for the Asana service account
- `ASANA_WORKSPACE_GID` — Workspace GID (find at `app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces`)
- `WORKITEMS_BOT_GID` — Asana user GID for the Workitems bot account (if deploying Workitems)
- `AGENT_FIELD_GID` — GID of the "Agent" custom field on Asana tasks (create it if it doesn't exist)
- Bot GIDs for any other agents being deployed (`DOCWRITER_BOT_GID`, `RESEARCHER_BOT_GID`)

**Confirm before proceeding.** Summarize what you collected and ask: "Does this look right?"

---

## Step 3 — Bootstrap AWS infrastructure

### 3a. Verify Bedrock model access

```bash
aws bedrock get-foundation-model \
  --model-identifier us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1 \
  --region $AWS_REGION
```

If this returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`, the user must request access in the AWS Bedrock console under **Model access** before continuing.

### 3b. Deploy shared infrastructure (SAM)

```bash
cd infra/foundation
sam build

sam deploy \
  --stack-name sdlc-agents-${STAGE} \
  --parameter-overrides \
    Stage=${STAGE} \
    WorkitemsBotGID=${WORKITEMS_BOT_GID:-""} \
    AgentFieldGID=${AGENT_FIELD_GID:-""} \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region $AWS_REGION \
  --guided   # remove --guided on subsequent deploys
```

This creates:
- DynamoDB table `dispatch-assignments-${STAGE}`
- S3 bucket `sdlc-agent-artifacts-${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}-${STAGE}`
- Lambda `dispatch-router-${STAGE}`
- Lambda `asana-webhook-${STAGE}` + API Gateway endpoint (for Asana)
- IAM role `GitHubActionsDeployRole` with OIDC trust (used by all deploy workflows)

After deploy, capture these outputs:
```bash
sam list stack-outputs --stack-name sdlc-agents-${STAGE} --region $AWS_REGION
```

Key outputs to save:
- `DeployRoleArn` → set as `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` GitHub secret
- `AsanaWebhookUrl` → register with Asana in Step 6

### 3c. Store secrets in SSM

```bash
# Asana PAT (if using Asana triggers)
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name /sdlc-agents/asana-pat \
  --value "$ASANA_PAT" \
  --type SecureString \
  --region $AWS_REGION

# Webhook secret is auto-populated by the Lambda on first Asana handshake
```

### 3d. Create ECR repositories

One per agent being deployed:

```bash
for agent in <AGENTS>; do
  aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name sdlc-agents/${agent} \
    --region $AWS_REGION
done
```

---

## Step 4 — Register the agent registry in SSM

The Dispatch Router reads agent configuration from SSM at runtime. After editing `.dispatch/agents.yaml` (Step 5), sync it:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name /sdlc-agents/${STAGE}/registry \
  --value "$(cat .dispatch/agents.yaml)" \
  --type String \
  --overwrite \
  --region $AWS_REGION
```

---

## Step 5 — Configure .dispatch/agents.yaml

Edit `.dispatch/agents.yaml`. For each agent being deployed:

1. Uncomment or add its entry
2. Set `runtime_arn` to `"${AGENT_RUNTIME_ARN}"` — this is a placeholder; the actual ARN is filled in after the first deploy (Step 7)
3. Set `authorization.users` to `["*"]` for open access, or list specific GitHub/Asana usernames

**Remove or comment out agents that are NOT being deployed.** The Dispatch Router will return a 404 for any mention of an unregistered agent.

For agents using Asana assignment triggers, set the bot GID environment variables in `infra/foundation/template.yaml`:
```yaml
Environment:
  Variables:
    WORKITEMS_BOT_GID: !Ref WorkitemsBotGID
    DOCWRITER_BOT_GID: !Ref DocwriterBotGID   # add parameter if needed
```

---

## Step 6 — Configure GitHub repository secrets

Go to the repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | ARN of the deploy role you created in Step 1.3 of `docs/aws-deploy.md` | Always |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | 12-digit account ID | Always |

The deploy workflows use OIDC — no long-lived AWS credentials are stored in GitHub.

**The SAM foundation stack does not create the OIDC provider or deploy role** — you (or the `sdlc-agents-provision-aws` skill's Step 0) create both by hand the first time the fleet is set up in an AWS account. See `docs/aws-deploy.md` §1.3 for the trust policy and rationale.

---

## Step 7 — Add deploy workflows for chosen agents

For each agent in `<AGENTS>`, verify a deploy workflow exists at `.github/workflows/deploy-<agent>.yml`. If one is missing, create it by copying the pattern:

```yaml
name: Deploy <Agent> Agent

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "agents/<agent>/**"
      - "agents/shared/**"

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy-agent.yml
    with:
      agent_name: <agent>
    secrets: inherit
```

The shared `deploy-agent.yml` workflow:
1. Builds the container from `agents/<agent>/Dockerfile`
2. Pushes to ECR (`sdlc-agents/<agent>`)
3. Runs Amazon Inspector security scan
4. Calls `aws bedrock-agentcore-control update-agent-runtime` to deploy
5. Waits for the runtime to become active
6. Runs a smoke test (`{"prompt": "health check"}`)

The deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-agent.yml`) creates the AgentCore Runtime on the first push and updates it on subsequent pushes — no manual `create-agent-runtime` step is needed. It uses the commit SHA as the image tag (ECR repositories are `IMMUTABLE` in this fleet). The runtime ARN is written back to `.dispatch/agents.yaml` by `scripts/sync_registry.py`, which runs as part of the deploy workflow.

To inspect an agent's runtime ARN later (e.g. for debugging):

```bash
aws bedrock-agentcore-control get-agent-runtime \
  --agent-runtime-name <agent> \
  --region $AWS_REGION \
  --query 'agentRuntimeArn' --output text
```

---

## Step 8 — Configure Asana integration (if applicable)

**Ask the user:** "Do you want Asana triggers? This lets users assign tasks to agents or mention them in Asana comments."

If yes:

### 8a. Create bot accounts in Asana

For each agent being deployed with Asana triggers, create a dedicated Asana user account (e.g. `workitems-bot@yourorg.com`). These are the accounts users will "assign" tasks to in order to trigger agents.

Retrieve each bot's GID:
```bash
curl -s "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/workitems-bot@yourorg.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_PAT" | jq -r '.data.gid'
```

### 8b. Create the "Agent" custom field (for custom_field triggers)

In Asana, create an Enum custom field called **Agent** with values matching each deployed agent name (`workitems`, `docwriter`, `researcher`). Retrieve its GID from the workspace:

```bash
curl -s "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces/$ASANA_WORKSPACE_GID/custom_fields" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_PAT" | jq '.data[] | select(.name=="Agent") | .gid'
```

### 8c. Register the webhook

The Asana webhook URL is the API Gateway endpoint from Step 3b (`AsanaWebhookUrl` output).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_PAT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"data\": {
      \"resource\": \"$ASANA_WORKSPACE_GID\",
      \"target\": \"$ASANA_WEBHOOK_URL\",
      \"filters\": [
        {\"resource_type\": \"story\", \"action\": \"added\"},
        {\"resource_type\": \"task\", \"action\": \"changed\", \"fields\": [\"assignee\", \"custom_fields\"]}
      ]
    }
  }"
```

Asana will send a handshake request immediately. The Lambda handles it automatically and stores the webhook secret in SSM. Verify in CloudWatch Logs for the `asana-webhook-${STAGE}` function.

---

## Step 9 — Configure GitHub @claude integration (optional)

**Ask the user:** "Do you want `@claude` to work in GitHub comments and PRs? This uses the `claude-code.yml` workflow."

If yes, no extra setup is needed — the workflow uses the same `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` secret and Bedrock OIDC access that was already configured. The IAM role needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` for `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1`.

To verify the permission is in place:
```bash
aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn $DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN \
  --action-names bedrock:InvokeModel \
  --resource-arns "arn:aws:bedrock:${AWS_REGION}::foundation-model/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7-v1"
```

---

## Step 10 — Trigger first deploy

Commit all changes and push to `main`. The deploy workflows will trigger for each agent whose files changed.

```bash
git add .dispatch/agents.yaml .github/workflows/ infra/
git commit -m "Configure agent fleet for deployment"
git push origin main
```

Monitor the Actions tab. Each agent deploy runs: build → scan → deploy → smoke test.

After all deploys succeed:
1. Update `.dispatch/agents.yaml` with the real `runtime_arn` values (from Step 7)
2. Re-sync the registry: `aws ssm put-parameter --name /sdlc-agents/${STAGE}/registry --value "$(cat .dispatch/agents.yaml)" --type String --overwrite`
3. Test end-to-end by commenting `@workitems health check` on a GitHub issue

---

## Verification checklist

Before reporting the setup as complete, confirm each of the following:

- [ ] `sam deploy` completed without errors
- [ ] ECR repos exist for all chosen agents
- [ ] AgentCore Runtimes are in `ACTIVE` state
- [ ] `.dispatch/agents.yaml` has real `runtime_arn` values (no `${...}` placeholders)
- [ ] SSM parameter `/sdlc-agents/${STAGE}/registry` is populated
- [ ] GitHub secrets `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` are set
- [ ] At least one deploy workflow has run and passed
- [ ] Smoke test passed (the deploy workflow runs it automatically)
- [ ] If Asana: webhook registered and handshake logged in CloudWatch
- [ ] If Asana: bot GIDs stored in SSM / Lambda environment variables
- [ ] `@claude` works on a test comment (if configured)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Deploy workflow fails at "Deploy to AgentCore Runtime"**
The Runtime must be created manually before the first CI deploy — `update-agent-runtime` cannot create a new one. Run the `create-agent-runtime` command from Step 7.

**Dispatch Router returns 404 for a known agent**
The SSM registry is stale or missing the agent entry. Re-run the `ssm put-parameter` command from Step 4.

**Asana webhook not triggering**
Check CloudWatch Logs for `asana-webhook-${STAGE}`. Common causes: webhook not registered, signature mismatch (SSM secret out of sync), or the Lambda's API Gateway URL changed after a stack update.

**Smoke test fails with "no recognized @agent mention"**
The registry doesn't include the agent yet, or the runtime ARN is still a placeholder. Check `.dispatch/agents.yaml` and re-sync SSM.

**`@claude` workflow fails with access denied on Bedrock**
The IAM role needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission. Check the SAM template's `GitHubActionsDeployRole` policy and redeploy if needed.
